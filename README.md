- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tunitt
- 👀 I’m interested in learning the art of DevOps. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python coding via Udemy courses which is on track, along with YouTube tutorials. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on startcup projects and people in the same boat as me. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...message me or email me. I'm happy to work on anything devops/python related.
- why am I doing this?
Ever since I was younger I had a passion for computers and the operating systems. Seeing hackers in movies fascinated me and wanted to learn more, however like with most things
life turned out differently and i chosen a different career path. Now fast forward 20 odd years I'm now in a postion to learn what I still love after all these years
......coding. With a goal of moving out of the UK and a tech career which suits remote working fine the combination is perfect. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to be
  remote working in Spain working my dream job. The money is a bonus too!! Iam happy to work up the ladder and as long as its a remote postion I will put every bit of me I to
  working hard for the right company who can believe in me.
